**Practical and realistic Web Assembly useÂ case**

If you are a regular tech blog reader, chances are that you have come into contact with WebAssembly (Wasm) and the hype that surrounds it. Put simply, WebAssembly is a byte code that can be executed by web browsers, which means that applications written in any language could be compiled into WebAssembly and then executed in your browser. The hype brings many quality articles and talks demonstrating use cases and advantages, such as fully coding your GUI in C++.

Getting your app into Google Play is an easy task, but Apple's App Store makes things a tad more difficult. Amongst many requirements, your app icon images must not have an alpha channel. Even if said alpha channel is unused. Now removing the alpha channel is not rocket sciene and a matter of minutes, using ImageMagick (written in C++) it can be achieved with a simple one liner. I embraced that and created a PWA that does exactly that.
